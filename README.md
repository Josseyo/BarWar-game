## The Bar Wars game 
– Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock

![Overview of the game on different screen sizes](assets/documentation/image-1.png)

Through global symbols and colors for pass and failure, this game can be used by anyone who is curious to play - or need to make a quick decision.

This project is developed as a gift for the Bar Wars community. A group of people who get together for drinks and to watch Star Wars movies. This is a yearly tradition and takes place the night before Christmas eve.

The Bar Wars game can be used for planning and decision making. What movies will you watch? Who will get the next round?  

In case of any clash of opinions the situation will quickly be solved with this game. 

Make it easy and let the game decide!

The game is based on the five elements theory and the episode of the comedy series “The big bang theory” in which Sheldon expands the ”Rock-paper-scissors"game to include “lizard” and “Spock” to increase the randomness of the outcome.

### Mouse hovers 

When the player hovers over the buttons to make their selection, the background color shifts to magenta and  a text is visible to remind the player of the button’s strengths and weaknesses, before they make their final decision. This makes it clear for the user which answer they are about to click to avoid mistakes of clicking the wrong answer.
